  ## Description
  This application allows the user to create, save, view, and delete notes on a webpage. The application uses the File System module from Node to read and write from the database file that stores the notes in JSON format, the Express framework to create and run the server, the UUID NPM package to assign an id to each note, and Heroku to deploy the application to an actual webpage. The application allows the user to visually see all of their created notes in one place, view each one individually, and delete any that the user no longer wants.

  ## Usage
  To use this application, the user would first navigate to the deployed webpage for the application. Then, the user would click the Get Started button on the homepage to be taken to the notes page where they will see a blank template to create notes. The user would start by typing a title for the note and then add body text for that specific note. Once the user is done writing their note, a save button icon will have appeared in the top right. They will click the save button on the top right of the page to save that note and then the note title will appear on the left side of the page. If the user wants to go back and read a previously saved note, they would click the note title on the left hand side of the page where all of their saved notes are located and then the blank template would be populated with the title and body data from their saved note. To create a new note, the user would click the + sign button on the top right of the page and they will be presented with a blank template for a new note. If the user ever wants to delete a note, they can click the red trash can icon next to the note title on the left side of the page and that note will then be deleted.
